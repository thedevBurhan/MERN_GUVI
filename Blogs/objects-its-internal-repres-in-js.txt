Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

- Javascript main design is to store all the objects in an key value pair, in-order for easy accessibility.
- Javascript intrerprets to object been created  and console or get the specific value requested from specific key from an objects.
- Javascript is an dynamic language.
- Javascript object concepts do vary when compared to diffrent programming languages like java. JS object do describes them in key:value
  pair,however we can change the values assigned for the keys. 
-objects can store multiple value in an single container in form of Key value pairs. objects are much more helpful in-oder to store
  the datas. 
- objects values can be stored in array, and array value can be stored in objects.
 

Example for primitive data types: 

var carName = "maruthi";
var carCostInLakhs =2; 

so in oder to know the complete function about the care, I need to call all the variable decalred, however in objects

var car1={
carName:"maruthi";
carCostInLakhs:2;
}

so by using object, I can store all the functions of an particular object in same container. and however these value can be reassigned as when there is an 
update in price of the car.

Example for changing the value in object:
var car1={
carName:"maruthi";
carCostInLakhs:2;
}
car1.carCostInLakhs=3;
console.log(car1.carCostInLakhs); Now the carCostInLakhs is 3.
