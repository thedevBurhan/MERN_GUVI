Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

objects:-

     -It is Complex Data types.
     -Objects are a structure of Key:value pair.
     -Example: syntax - var objectname={keyname:value};
     -Object name is also called as the reference name.
     -objects does not have indexes.
     -objects Without Key does not have values.
     -objects values can be stored in array, and array value can be stored in objects.
     -object can be access by two methods:-
             *  DOT method (.) 
                  Example: objectname.keyname (it will give you the value of the key holds)
             *   Box Method []
                  Example: objectname["keyname"] (it will give you the value of the key holds)   

Internal representation in Javascript:-

     - Javascript main design is to store all the objects in an key value pair, in-order for easy accessibility.
     - Javascript intrerprets to object been created  and console or get the specific value requested from specific key from an objects.
     - Javascript is an dynamic language.
     - Javascript object concepts do vary when compared to diffrent programming languages like java. JS object do describes them in key:value
  pair,however we can change the values assigned for the keys. 
     -objects can store multiple value in an single container in form of Key value pairs. objects are much more helpful in-oder to store
  the datas. 
  

Example for primitive data types: 

var carName = "maruthi";
var carCostInLakhs =2; 

so in oder to know the complete function about the car, I need to call all the variable decalred, however in objects

var car1={
carName:"maruthi";
carCostInLakhs:2;
}

so by using object, I can store all the functions of an particular object in same container. and however these value can be reassigned as
when there is an update in price of the car.

Example for changing the value in object:

var car1={
carName:"maruthi";
carCostInLakhs:2;
}

by DOT method  changing the value in the object:-

      car1.carCostInLakhs=3;
      console.log(car1.carCostInLakhs); Now the carCostInLakhs is 3.

by Box Method []  changing the value in the object:-

      car1["carCostInLakhs"]=3;
      console.log(car1["carCostInLakhs"]); Now the carCostInLakhs is 3.
